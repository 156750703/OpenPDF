The original code was released under the BSD license, and contained the following
extra restriction: "You acknowledge that Software is not designed, licensed or intended

In a mail sent to Bruno Lowagie on January 23, 2008, Brian Burkhalter (@sun.com)
writes: "This code is under a BSD license and supersedes the older codec packages
on which your code is based. It also includes numerous fixes among them being the
ability to handle a lot of 'broken' TIFFs."

Note that numerous fixes were applied to the code used in iText by Paulo Soares,
but apart from the fixes there were no essential changes between the code that
was originally adapted and the code that is now available under the following

The main difference can be found in the final paragraph: the restriction
that the source code is not "licensed" in this particular situation has
been removed.

FYI: Brian also added: "A bit of history might be in order.
The codec classes that you used originally were based on some
classes included with JAI but not strictly part of JAI.
As of Java SE 1.4 an official Image I/O framework was
added in javax.imageio.... This frameork supports these formats:

Java 1.4: GIF (read only), JPEG, PNG
Java 1.5: Added support for BMP and WBMP
Java 1.6: Added support for writing GIF

The JAI Image I/O Tools packages (jai-imageio-core) were created
to support formats handled by JAI but not included in Java SE
as well as some new things like JPEG2000."
